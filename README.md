Notes for Deploying onto Github.io:

- "npm start" = starts development preview in browser
- "npm run deploy" = runs the build for react and saves to master branch
- "git add ." = adds new changes to staging area
- "git commit" = captures a snapshot of projects currently stages changes
- "git push origin" = pushes the snapshot to online github directory
